				<p>I am originally from Mexico, but I was studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain for the whole semester.<br>
					Due to COVID-19 I had to end my semester 4 months earlier than expected and return home.</p>
				<p>Returning home was a race against Spain's lockdown. I had to flew from Barcelona to Madrid and then to<br>
					Mexico city (I don't live there) so I can later then grab a plane back home.</p>
				<p>I got out from Barcelona on a Saturday, and strict lockdown and travel restrictions began the <br>
					next day, Sunday. My parents where really worried I wouldn't be able to make it. Thankfully I did.</p>
				<p>At that time Mexico's government did not had any rules for people flying from Spain or Italy.<br>
					So I when I got home I had to make a responsable action an quarantine myself to avoid any risk with my family or friends.<br>
					I was in quarentine for 14 days, without seeing or talking to anyone.</p>
				<p>I also had to cancel my exchange program due to time difference and primarily languane switched to Catalan.<br>
					So back home, after the quarentine my college re-integrated me on some courses (that were already switched to online) <br>
					so I don't loose the semester. </p>
